            <p>
              '05 Hongkonger that is equally bad at everything <img id="aEmoji1" src="/assets/omega_chair.gif" alt="Omega_Wheelchair_Emoji">
              <br><br>
              Currently studying Applied AI at HKU but planning to emigrate, because STEM people have no future here.
              <br><br>
              Have an interest in most things but can't actually be competent in any of them  <img id="aEmoji2" src="/assets/pepe_sadge.png" alt="Pepe_sadge">
              <br>However, I do wish to create a startup. I have no idea what it will be about, maybe sth related to AI since it's pretty fire recently.
              <br> Creativity is the only path forward in a world where everything is automated anyways.
              <br><br>
              I have preferred pronouns (<abbr title="Did you just assume my gender???"><span id="aUnderlineTooltip1">hokzar/poorjar</span></abbr>),
              but you may call me a trashcan or anything you like, I don't really care.
              <br><br>
              Also, I hate nerds and I am not a nerd. People who think I am a nerd are the nerdiest of the nerds

            <h2>What I'm Doing</h2>
            <h4>Last Updated March 2, 2024</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><span id="aLargeText1">Reading <i>The Thomas Sowell Reader</i></span> <br>
                Very based work in my opinion, when you realize that most of the "problems" in society are artificial constructs distracting you from the truthful reality.
                <br> Will probably look into more of his works in the future
                <br><br>
                Future books I plan to read:
                <ul>
                  <li>Rich Dad Poor Dad</li>
                  <li>In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><span id="aLargeText2">Working as a pseudo web-developer</span><br>
                I'm not really a web developer and honestly full-time developers suck, I'd rather make a startup - they say "Go big or go home".<br><br>
                I learnt JavaScript from deobfuscating <a href="https://territorial.io">territorial.io</a> and as a result I inherited a lot of bad coding practices.<br>
                I created algorithms that would theoretically dominate in matches, and <abbr title="The frenchies"><span id="aUnderlineTooltip2">some people</span></abbr> tried to frame me for cheating
                <br>PLOT TWIST: they backfired, and now I write updates for the game from time to time xD. <br><br>
                I am also working on my own game called <b>Evoku</b>. Basically sudoku but evolved with multiplayer and powerups.
                Let's see how good that goes <img id="aEmoji3" src="/assets/shining_blob.gif" alt="Shining_Blob">
                <br><br>
                Oh, and I'm also updating this website. Later I'll add a sidebar for custom single-page navigation.
              </li>
              <li><span id="aLargeText3">Wasting Society Resources</span><br>
                Because I don't deserve them <img id="aEmoji4" src="/assets/fast_chair.png" alt="Fast_Wheelchair_Emoji">
