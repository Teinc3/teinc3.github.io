### Currently Reading
Too busy with Uni work LOL, imaging having the time to read a book.

### Plan to Read

#### "The Peter Principle" by Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull
Recently stumbled across this "Peter Principle" thingy, 
which appears to be a niche management theory that describes how in a hierarchical organization, 
employees tend to rise to their "level of incompetence".

And from a software engineering perspective it makes lots of sense.
Just take a look at `r/programmerhumor` on Reddit. You'll see tons and tons of memes about junior devs being promoted to senior devs,
only to find themselves immersed in meetings and management tasks that they hate doing.
I'm pretty sure they'd die going back to coding, even if it means going back to a junior.

Personally, I hate coding, but unfortunately I'm considered relatively good at it.
I've also been in management and administration for multiple online games, and I kinda learnt how navigating the hierarchy works -
but I'm mostly too lazy to actually do the management work needed. I'd rather build a system to manage them automatically.
So I wonder how far I can go up the hierarchy before I reach my level of incompetence.

I wonder what would happen when I talk about this theory in my EEM application essay (Engineering, Entrepreneurship, and Management).
I suppose that because it's niche enough, my essay might stand out a bit more, 
and they might actually think I know something about management.
Gotta know how hard it is to even be selected for that program (16 spots out of a 185 cohort).
But <a href="/blogs/a_refined_plan">I think I can make it</a>, we'll see.


### Completed

#### "Woke Inc" by Vivek Ramaswamy
Again forgot when I completed this, but it was also quite interesting.

#### "How to win every argument" by Mehdi Hasan
Forgot when I completed this, but it was a good read.

#### "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki
Completed on April 3, 2024

After reading this book I guess I learnt half of what it was supposed to teach me.
The other half I kinda already know from personal experience.

Probably a good refresher on concepts regarding financial literacy, 
and sometimes Kiyosaki's words can be pretty cult-like and unpleasant to the average reader unwilling to change their mindset, 
but I do particularly enjoy using "Rat Race" in my vocabulary now.

I guess this book and oi helped me realize that I should start learning how to invest,
and I do have a greater emphasis on long-term investment targeting emerging countries and industries.
A good base in geopolitics and economical theory always helps in this regard.

#### The Thomas Sowell Reader
Completed on March 6, 2024

Very based work in my opinion, when you realize that most of the "problems" in society are artificial constructs distracting you from the truthful reality.

Will probably look into more of his works in the future
