## Reading List
*Last Updated: January 16, 2026*

### Currently Reading

None... And no plans to start any new books soon.
Maybe in the future I'll list a few Russian books that I'm reading.

### Completed

#### "How to win every argument" by Mehdi Hasan
Forgot when I completed this, but it was a good read.

#### Rich Dad Poor Dad
Completed on April 3, 2024

After reading this book I guess I learnt half of what it was supposed to teach me.
The other half I kinda already know from personal experience.

Probably a good refresher on concepts regarding financial literacy, 
and sometimes Kiyosaki's words can be pretty cult-like and unpleasant to the average reader unwilling to change their mindset, 
but I do particularly enjoy using "Rat Race" in my vocabulary now.

I guess this book and oi helped me realize that I should start learning how to invest,
and I do have a greater emphasis on long-term investment targeting emerging countries and industries.
A good base in geopolitics and economical theory always helps in this regard.

#### The Thomas Sowell Reader
Completed on March 6, 2024

Very based work in my opinion, when you realize that most of the "problems" in society are artificial constructs distracting you from the truthful reality.

Will probably look into more of his works in the future


### Plan to Read

Maybe "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham and "Woke Inc." by Vivek Ramaswamy
