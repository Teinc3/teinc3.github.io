It's no secret that I am quite interested in Eastern European geography and culture.
Playing Tanki Online when I was 10, I memorised the entire cyrillic alphabet because I wanted to understand what the woman 
starring in the Tanki VLogs was saying (I ended up not understanding anything, but at least I can read them properly).
And ever since I started playing ProTanki for almost 3 years, I've interacted quite a lot with the Russian and
Ukrainian communities in game, knowing how to read basic phrases and commands, and yielding simple responses.

But as a person from Hong Kong that currently lives in England, I've experienced all sorts of cultures in person,
with the unique exception of the one that I've longed to explore. Eastern Slavic culture.
And it essentially is the golden trio of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, which I'm not gonna lie but I'd like to visit Moscow,
Saint P, and Eastern Ukraine one day, including Donetsk and Kharkiv.
But with Ukraine bombed into complete rubble and Russian imperialism fundamentally conflicting with my personal values,
it just seems like Belarus is the one country that I'd like to connect with more deeply.

We Hongkongers experienced the protests of 2019 and know what standing up to modern authoritarianism looks and feels like.
And I see Belarusians as no strangers to that either. I've seen how an election can be rigged even in broad daylight,
and how exodus from political persecution feels like for the extraordinary people. The only difference is, I suppose,
that our financial standing is better than theirs (Thanks Capitalism ig), but I will still give them more credit for
their bravery in risking financial stability just to stand up for freedom and a better future.

It's not necessarily political suppression but also on the cultural end that both Hongkongers and Belarusians share.
We have our own local language, Cantonese, spoken by natives of Hong Kong and Canton,
but is actively being suppressed by the government from usage over the "Prestigious" (absolutely BS) Mandarin chinese.
It's the same for the Belarusian language (which unfortunately, I have no knowledge of), but given the chance,
I might try to pick up a few phrases, through my existing knowledge of Russian.
And I'm sure that as one of the most educated and intelligent people in the world,
Belarusians would also be keen on learning other languages and preserving cultures in the face of adversity.

If people from Belarus are not as skeptical of Asians as people from the anglosphere world are - then I might just perhaps,
make some friends there, even though I have completely no clue how language barriers may affect such an experience.
But ultimately it is pure speculation for now, even as I highly admire the intelligence and resilience that Belarusians exhibit.
