# Welcome, Singapore

There's once this saying that the three financial capitals of the world are New York, London, Hong Kong.
But nobody really expected that to completely upheave within measely a decade or so. 
Well, congratulations, Singapore, you have now deservingly earned the 3rd (or even 2nd) spot.

Hong Kong's demise itself is rather tragic. I'm from there, so I can vouch for that.
From being the freeest metropolis in the world in terms of economic freedom, *once praised by Milton Friedman himself*,
it has slumped down into a **Tier-2 City** where everything is simply overwhelmed by Chinese economic influence.
Our dogshit government can say whatever they want but the fact that they can't maintain a separate status from China is already a testament to that.
Like wtf, do you understand that being unique and separate from the Chinese economy is what made Hong Kong so special in the first place?
There's no doubt it still serves as a gate between the East and the West, but Shanghai is already doing the heavy lifting.
The fact that you failed to diversify your economy in the 00s while keeping the bootlicking ultimately led to our downfall.

Some people insist that Tokyo is a better choice as the Asian financial capital, but in my opinion that's just a joke.
I might be biased, but the Japanese economy has already slumped for 30 years and shows **NO** sign of revitalisation at all.
From one of the world's richest and largest economies (They almost had *twice* America's GDP per capita in the early 90s - although much of that is attributed to a bubble),
to a stagnant and aging society with little growth potential, eclipsed by South Korea and even Taiwan.
To factor in Tokyo as a financial centre is simply funny at best. But some people still do that, I understand.

So that leaves us with two cities: New York and London. Or is it?
Yesterday everyone witnessed Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Mayoral Election, beating the disgraceful Andrew Cuomo (Cuomontang vs Maodani reference???) by a near 10 point margin.
And look, when you have a fucking socialist enter office for the city that single-handedly defined capitalist success in the world,
you know something is going wrong.
Establishment Democrats are always pro-corporatism (not pro-capitalism - big difference, as the former still encourages big Government intervention and huge, inefficient enterprises),
but Mamdani now wants to nuke everything, not only the corporates, but also capitalism itself.
I mean, good luck trying to tax the rich out of existence in a city where the rich are the ones who already fund most things.
*I'm sure that will work out*. Don't forget to freeze their assets before they can leave the city for Texas, genius.

At least the mayor of London still knows not to fuck around with socialism.
Yes, he somehow promotes woke policies (ULEZ is Dogshit) and to some degree supports islamist values, but at least he keeps the economic engine running.
You know when the entirety of England's economy is running on thin ice and facing hardships it's really London that's powering everything, Westminster knows that and simply won't let anything happen to London.

But not in America I guess, they like being federal and the government can't intervene too much in regional politics.
I think Trump is trying to mess with Zohran but that's kinda unconstitutional in some way and I doubt it will work out.
So say goodbye to HK and NYC. 
I personally think London can still survive for some time until the extreme left (something worse than Sadiq Khan, maybe the Greens)
come to power, or even the extreme right, if they insist on expanding socialist policies (cuz horseshoe theory is always a thing).

So now with 2 of the 3 financial capitals completely fucked up and the 3rd one being a joke, who will bear the torch and take the mantle?

**Singapore, of course**.
And I wish you well, for a city-state that knows how to balance geopolitical interests, maintain economic freedom while keeping social order.
You've done everything the theory taught you to do, and now with the self-implosion of your competitors, it's finally time for you to shine.
