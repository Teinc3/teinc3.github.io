## I think I found my Future

Revising for exams is not fun, thats why I'm taking some time off to write this short article.

I realised that I'm actually quite involved in applications of Engineering in human-computer interactions.
I've been working with multiple projects involving AI and audio (such as AI accent recognition and conversation tip app),
and my summer job involves making a 3D tool and pipelines for cancer cell annotations.
I also look forward to a future where brain transfers and perhaps integration of AI-assistance into our brains are possible.
It would be insanely dope to be part of the team that realises that dream. BCI is just so cool, i mean.
So maybe, if I'm cracked, I can try landing a job at Neuralink, or a competitor firm in case I don't get in, thats my current plan.
Maybe not starting my own company for that yet, because the field is kinda already saturated.
Plus I don't know that much about it for now so its better to gain some experience or knowledge on it first.

I actually think this is the first time I have a clear idea of what I want to do in the future.
Perhaps during a few years ago, I do broadly know that I want to do something with AI or just tech in general,
but maybe not a specific field yet, at least now I know where I want to go.
And this isn't even a fraction of what I want to do in the future.
I actually plan to pursue two routes - one in the BCI field and the other fully in the creative field.
By creative, I mean making world-famous music and popular web-games with the help of AI.
I mean right now AI kinda sucks so I could still enlist the help of a few friends for now for game development,
and I do plan on doing that first before I start working hard on music.

And I don't mind making startups when I'm in the creative industry.
I think having one career where you rise up the ranks procedurally in a traditional tech company,
and having another career where you make the rules yourself, is a good balance.
In case one fails, you still have the other to fall back on.
That's essentially what I'm doing for my career path as well.
Applying for internships to enrich your CV so you land a good and stable job after graduation,
and making sure you also spend much time on side projects, so any of them, if successful, can become your main career.

I know this looks like hope and dreams, but I'm quite confident in my own abilities.
And I do know I have some natural talent in this, so I don't think it's that unrealistic, and I'll definitely work on that.
But for now, time to get back to studying for my exams...
