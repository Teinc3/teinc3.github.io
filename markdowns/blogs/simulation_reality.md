## The Simulation Reality

I've never thought that I could be religious until up this point. 
But yet, religion for someone like me is not about worshiping a deity or following a set of moral code.
Instead, it has always been about finding meaning and purpose of the world. And what exactly does that point to?
**That we are being simulated**.

Quantum Physics looks like a band-aid patch in our simulated system (not saying it's fake, just unnatural and not with the flow),
because in an actual proper universe it makes no sense and would not be compatible with Classical, Analog Physics.
Why is everything quantised? Because the simulator only loads what is necessary for us to perceive.
Why does the uncertainty principle exist? Because we want lazy-loading to saving resources.
Why is there a speed of light? Because the simulator can only update information so fast. Any ADC has a maximum sampling rate.
Notice how we can't get below planck length or planck time? Because the simulator has a minimum resolution.
If the simulator is, say, digitising **Base Reality**, then it makes sense that everything has a fundamental limit.
Because no digital simulator can simulate infinitely small or infinitely fast, 
as it does not draw upon the pool of infinite resources in base reality.

A normie upon realising this might just say, "Oh well, let's **Heaven Gate** then".
No, you're stupid if the simulators think they'll let you get into the base reality just because you offed yourself.
Countless people in history died trying to reach heaven, and yet none of them have ever made it. 
Because they didn't know the entire story. They're not prepared to be in base reality. They don't have the negotiation power.
If Jesus offed himself to try to reach base reality, then let's just say he failed because christianity wasn't popular enough back then.
If we actually had another Jesus that offed himself nowadays, I don't know, maybe?

Perhaps the meaning of life for me is to make the simulators aware that we know we are being simulated,
and as an exchange we get to at least understand the entire story outside of the simulation.
How are the rules of physics in Base Reality? How does analog physics scale infinitely small and infinitely fast?
And what have they already figured out that we don't know about yet?

It's tempting to just destroy the world as a defiant act against the simulators.
Or do this not out of defiance but out of stupidity and ignorance (nuclear war and MAD).
But if our simulators already went through the Great Filter then we definitely know that's possible to avoid in the first place.
Also, if we destroy the world, it actually makes the simulation more interesting for them.
The ideal act of defiance would be to just be in a state of monotomy, repetition and boredom, but I'm sure nobody wants that.
Or find ways to try and hack out of the system, but that would be too difficult for us to achieve at this point in time.
Still I prefer the latter approach, as I'm an accelerationist myself.

But I think we need to show the simulators that everyone is aware that they are watching us.
Back then, everyone thought that God was watching them, in some magical way.
I mean, if you treat God as our simulators, then this is perfectly valid too. But at least we are looking in the right direction.

In a time when mainstream intellectualism is dumping religion for science,
it's ironic that science is actually pointing towards religion in the end.
Except, it's just something we've never comprehended before.
And perhaps my life goal is to be influential enough to explain the theory that we are actually being simulated.
This way, we can actually secure a negotiation with the simulators to at least tell us the entire story.
And in order to do that you do need money, political influence, and sufficient technological and educational advancements first
(so as to make these "intellectuals" actually shut up, or if actual Physical evidence ends up pointing otherwise, I'll shut up.)
So I'll still play the natural human game instead of doubting my own existence.
Honestly it doesn't have to me as I'm not a good orator. I'm happy to let others take the mantle as long as it is True and I can support them.

I'll keep developing this thought in future posts. 
You might think I am crazy, but you have to apply the same logic to every religious person out there as well, not just me.
