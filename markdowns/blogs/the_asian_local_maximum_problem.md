## The Asian Local Maximum Problem

### Introduction
(Disclaimer: Asian refers to exclusively East Asians here - let South Asians be their own category, they're already a quarter of the world)

It's not a surprise that nowadays you see elite universities in america close to one-third Asian.
Proper Universities rely on "meritocracy" (DEI once bucked the trends, but they don't help with the difficult content covered),
and guess what meritocracy is comprised of? 90% hard work, and 10% general intelligence.
With a slightly higher-than-baseline general intelligence and a hardcore work ethic, of course Asians come up on top of the pile.

But when you as an Asian actually go in and study the content taught in universities, you realise that essentially everything is European.
STEM, Humanities, Economics and Finance, almost all of it has European roots.
Take a look at what companies we have in the world. Sure, you see a few Asian CEOs here and there,
but the (co)founders of Google, Facebook etc. are exclusively of European heritage.
Samsung, TSMC, Toyota - these are all highly successful Asian companies that now dominate different sectors of the market,
but the core technology (phones, semiconductors, automobiles) were all invented by Europeans (or Americans with European descent).
So why is it that almost all of the inventions are European yet Asians are the best at acquiring and mastering this knowledge?

It's because of the **Asian Local Maximum Problem**.

### 2000 Years of Bureaucracy - the Perfect Local Maximum
Suppose that you're on a mountain, and you want to get to the highest point. You climb it by going up, until you reach the peak.
To find a taller mountain, you'll have to first re-descend into the valley, 
then climb up another mountain again (hoping that it's taller than the previous one).

See how this is going? Asian society has long been dominated by bureaucratic absolutism.
And I hate to say it but this is the most efficient **pre-modern** way of running a society.
China didn't need to explore the world, because it had everything it needed within its borders,
or facilitate limited trade with its immediate neighbors, which it dominates.
China didn't need to innovate its political system, because if reforms come, the bureaucracy (cough cough deep state) drowns it out,
and if reforms don't come, the country faces imminent collapse,
from either nomadic hordes in the north (overcentralisation leading to corruption) or internal warlords (overdecentralisation).

For thousands of years such a massive population had thinkers and reformers stuck trying to minimax this system,
because in an agrarian society dominated by agricultural output, the only way to get more output is to get more people working on the land,
and not to trade and innovate with other neighboring countries. And the more minimaxing you do,
the better you proceed within this flawed system, and the lesser the incentive to take a risk and explore other systems.

Contrast this to Europe, which had a much smaller population, itself split into many different countries,
each competing with others for resources and power. It's significantly harder to minimax your way up to absolutism,
with less population to work with in the first place. With trade also mandatory for survival (there are simply goods that you can't produce),
there's a much higher incentive to explore new lands and perhaps innovate new technologies to get an edge over your neighbors.

That's the reason why we now have millions of Asians excelling in exams,
because centralised testing was invented for 2000 years and the culture has been perfectly optimised for it.
Hardworking and grinding are always awarded, never risk-taking and innovation (seen as laziness and recklessness),
because they simply aren't worth it after calculating the opportunity cost.

### Fixing the Problem
And honestly - it's really simple. Just completely overhaul the culture Asians are instilled upon, as well as their general education system.
This is something people in China probably cannot do (simply because the conservative base of the population swamps any calls for reform),
yet in a western country where, more often than not,
Asian immigrants have their personalities selected for taking risks and living in unfamiliar environments, it's entirely possible.

The easiest way is to cater to a special tailored education system - 50% test taking, 50% creative projects.
Encourage living overseas and exploring multi-faceted disciplines relevant to the practical side of things, not just ones for exams.
While Asian parents will certainly encourage grind culture at home to a certain extent, 
schools can balance this out by encouraging and rewarding creative approaches/discourses, even if they don't always work out.
Study the biographies of successful innovators and entrepreneurs, instead of smearing them as capitalist, greedy pigs.

And this is essentially the best of both worlds that you can do. By putting 50% of your time dedicating to grinding over to creative thinking,
you avoid diminishing returns of grinding excessively, while unlocking a brand new perspective of the world,
that allows you to make something original, and not making slight improvements on something that already exists.

### Summary
The bureaucracy is a hill, but what is possible lies beyond a mountain range,
so as Asians, let's start hiking - ascents and descents are both necessary.
