## ChatGPT Intellectuals

Now that I'm back at Oxford I've been seeing a lot more Academics or so called "Intellectuals" around, 
or at least people who like to think of themselves that way. It's not something that you'll see a lot in Hong Kong,
as even though statistically Hongkongers have high IQ, the IQ in Oxford should be higher due to the University inherently selecting for it.

But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of them are using ChatGPT. And I know that the Uni does have something of an agreement with OpenAI,
but it hasn't even taken effect yet. So WHY ARE YOU STILL USING CHATGPT?

Look, I know that ChatGPT took the storm during early 2023. Bard and other LLMs were not good. Claude, Grok and Deepseek did not exist.
It MADE SENSE to use ChatGPT back then. 
But now, in 2026, do you not realise that there are so many better alternatives? 

Look, in the long run Gemini and Grok are just gonna be way better simply because of the resources that Google and Elon Musk have.
It's really stupid to think that OpenAI can keep up with them, unless they actually explicitly turn to Microsoft.
And that's just gonna give Elon Musk room to sue the crap out of them again.

The worst part is that I've seen Google run SO MANY ADS advertising Gemini for university students and academics. 
They literally said you can use Gemini FREE for <b>15 MONTHS</b>. 
I think they recently tuned the trial period down to 12 months, but still, it's FREE.
AND YET YOU ARE STILL USING THE FREE VERSION OR PAYING FOR CHATGPT PLUS?

Nothing beats the peak of stupidity than seeing such stubbornness. Most of ChatGPT models aren't good anyways.
I've worked with both services since 2023, and right now, I can say that Gemini is simply better across the board.
Just as an example, I've tested a real-time translation module for ProTanki using Gemini 2.5 Flash (an outdated model) and GPT 5 mini.
Gemini actually gave translations that made sense, while GPT was even struggling to identify the language properly.

So please, for the love of God, learn to ditch your comfort zone. So called "Intellectuals", you're better than this.
