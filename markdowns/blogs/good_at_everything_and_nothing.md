# Good at Everything, Good at Nothing

## Preface
You probably know me as somebody that says I'm a Poorjar, a.k.a. a poor and hokjar (academically inept) person.
And you'll be correct. But just for this time I'm not going to repeat that rhetoric for once.

## Article
I realized that I'm good at a lot of things. But yet, the nature of communal life coerces us into "specialisation".
And whenever I try to specialise in something, I hit the barrier that prevents me from being the best at it.
So, yeah, I'm Poorjar. Poorjar to the best of the best, which I always compare myself to. Multiverse to the normal people.

Talk about IQ? 150 is no easy feat, but it's not 160.
Talk about music? Perfect pitch is not bad, but i can't make the tunes that resonate in my mind resonate in millions of other's minds.
Talk about hacking or cheating? Sure I can make botting programs, but that's it.
I can't even deface any coporate website or apply any injection techniques that I've mastered for the past 5 years.
Talk about sports? It's only Orienteering, which is some semi-toned down, nerdy version of cross country running. 
And can I even represent any sort of national, or hell even regional team in a competition abroad? Hell no.

And these are only the stuff which I think I am semi-decent at.
Social skills are just a dumpsterfire, funny how I even think dorks have a chance.

Ideas keep floating in my mind but it's always a shame I can't execute all of them. If i could, i would already be "successful".
Just 1 idea can make me a top artist in the world, a top entrepreneur, a top influencer, or anything like that (idk).

I view the present time as something which I could defer in exchange for experience.
I strongly believe that Gen Z will live an average length of 150 years if not higher up to immortality.
Who cares if I fail right now? I can still try next year, next next year, next next next year...
My original plan was to only get a relationship when I reach 30 years old. And I am right on track.

Technological advancements and automations will also help me massively up until they could themselves replace what I'm doing.
I'm a human using these tools of the future. If the tools evolve to becoming their own user, then I will be nothing. This strategy will fail.
So, I'm still racing against time, even if the time scale we're talking about is around 20 or 30 years from now.

They started yapping about vibe coding recently as a trend but I've been *vibe coding* for the past 2 years, strictly speaking.
The vibe coders get themselves sunk into heaps and heaps of bugs, themselves being complete amateurs without any knowledge of computing.
But I'm different. I have the base knowledge. I claim to be good at everything.
I'm just good at nothing, in the professional sense. And AI will be my tool.

The day will come, the day will come. Even if it doesn't come, I'll still know that in 99% of other alternate universes,
the form that resembles my character will be the one that will be the most successful.
I'll just be the unlucky one in this 1% of a universe where I failed with 150 years to do something and fumble it massively.

## P.S.
During the latest Engineering subject dinner we had a section where one guy from each yeargroup gets to talk shit about their classmates.
I had no idea they actually read my blogs but if thats the case here you go, this article is a tribute to you.
It's better to know me by stalking me, because there are a lot of things that I wouldn't want to explicitly mention in front of people.
Enjoy your life, your soul has hundreds of years in front of you, if not thousands, millions...
