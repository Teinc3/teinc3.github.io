## Daily Agenda
*Date: February 27, 2025*

This weekend is super aids bro
I cant imagine it being already 1 year that I haven't uploaded an agenda or anything like that...
Besides the fact that on first draft i wrote 2024 instead of 2025 :skulleat:

### Code
#### ProTanki
- Angular moderation tools backend for scpacker and john
- ProboTanki bot algorithm + expand discord bot integration features (Names Registerer)

#### Territorial.io
- Preview window for next maps...
- I'm supposed to do like 6 hours of work per week in terri, idk if i can manage that much, i'll see

#### Evoku
- Conference meeting with venture forge mentor
- Just slacking off

#### Family
- Webapp with grok integration for dad's financial purposes (trading nerds smh...)

### School
- 2 Problem sheets (i'm quite amazed that I was able to finish 3 this week)


And of course, that means postponing subliminal, music production, beatboxing practices
(maybe not beatboxing, cuz i do it every day, i just don't have time to learn new techniques... sadge)
