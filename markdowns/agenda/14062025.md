## Daily Agenda
*Date: June 14, 2025*

Exams finally ended (Unfortunately I think I only have like a 30-40% chance of getting a 1º a.k.a Pass w/distinction),
but at least I can start doing stuff I want to do again.

### New Routine
I'm thinking of trying a new summer routine that involves:

- Waking up at 4:00 AM and eat something (If I'm eating something heavy later, then I'll just do some biscuits or an apple)
- Work for an hour
- Go to the gym at 5:00-5:30 AM for an hour (or go for a 5-10k run), then take a shower
- Come back and continue sleeping until 8:30 AM
- Have Breakfast at 8:30-9:00 AM
- Play some games and work until 1PM
- Have Lunch
- Continue working until 6PM
- Have dinner at 6-7PM
- Games/Youtube unless I have sth to go out for
- Sleep at 9PM

This gives me around 7+1 hours of sleep which should be fine for me.
Thing is most people are going to be out of town so I probably won't have a lot of social interaction.
But if people that are staying organise some events in the clubs I could still go out,
It's just that I might not prefer staining my image with the group before I get myself from a 3 to a 7-8. 

### Stuff I need to complete in this summer
Of course 
#### Work
- 3DxN
- Maybe some "AI" projects that my Dad's tech company wants me to help with

#### Personal Projects
- Botting
- Tanki Projects (Mod Tools, New Ratings/main site, Helpers Bot, etc.)
- Evoku (Still have to find an artist/animator lol, but I think I know who to ask)
- Auricue (Prepare for incubator in september)

#### Personal Enrichment
- Learn some usable Russian
- Learn how to mix with ableton more effectively
- Beatbox more artificial-looking sounds
- Create a custom subliminal message that I will play with alarmy every night
