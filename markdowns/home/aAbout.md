<p>Have an interest in most things but can't actually be competent in any of them.

I have preferred pronouns (<abbr title="Honestly who cares about pronouns these days smh"><span id="aUnderlineTooltip1">application/json</span></abbr>). 

Also, I hate nerds and I am not a nerd. People who think I am a nerd are the nerdiest of the nerds <i>:CHECKMATE:</i>

**Side Note**: If you ever came here before 2026, you might recognise that I used to have a different About Me section!
That's because I decided to rewrite it to better reflect who I am now.
See if you remember what I wrote back then - No cheating by looking at Commit History :P
